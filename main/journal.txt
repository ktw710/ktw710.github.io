		<h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>What industries led Korean Development</b></h3>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The economy of South Korea is the 11th largest in the world. South Korea is known for rising from one of the poorest countries in the world to a developed country in just a few generations. After thirty five years of Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War, Korean per capital GDP was 65 dollars in 1955 less than Gabon, the poorest Africa country. But now it is 31,940 dollars in 2019. South Korea doesn’t have any substantial natural resources, and the road to the mainland is blocked by North Korea. Then how could South Korea grow so fast? Korea first invested in key industries that could be connected to various things.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;President Park Chung-hee, the man who led Korea's economic development or the dictator who staged coup, built steel mills from the funds of Japan's 35-year colonial compensation in spite of public opposition. Since then, the steel industry has developed, and steel plates have become the main export item of Korea. In turn, this has led to the start of various industries. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Construction has been an important South Korean global industry since the early 1960s. According to Wikipedia, by 1981 overseas construction projects, most of them in the Middle East, accounted for 60 percent of the work undertaken by South Korean construction companies. Samsung Construction Co, one of the Korean Construction Companies, has built the tallest buildings since 1998: Petronas Towers, Taipei 101, and Burj-Khalifa.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the direction of the President, Park Chu-young, Hyundai-Kia Chairman, made a shipping company. The company started as a subcontractor for a Japanese shipping company. But during the 1970s and 1980s, South Korea became a leading producer of ships, including oil supertankers, and oil-drilling platforms. In 2019, Korea still has the most important ship orders. The country's major shipbuilders are Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Park Chu-young wanted to make cars as well. Hyundai Motors also started as a subcontractor of Ford. But the automobile industry became one of South Korea's major growth and export industries in 1980s. In 2019, Korea is the sixth largest car-making country. In addition, semiconductors and electronic devices are one of the major industries in Korea. Samsung, SK and LG are leading this industry.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the unprecedented rapid growth, side effects have also arisen. There was a serious problem that some companies like Samsung, Hyundai, LG, SK account for a large part of the Korean economy. And the gap between the rich and the poor has been widening and the generational conflict has been getting worse. Moreover, because the government and company have only invested to profitable industries, the basic academic industry and agriculture industries stagnate.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But the poorest countries without substantial natural resources need to consider Korea, which has seen unprecedented rapid growth around the world. Korea invested heavily in key industries that could be connected to many other high value-added industries. And, with the government's enormous support and policies to encourage major companies, Korea has been able to develop rapidly. </p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>The effects of war on civilian society</b></h3>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The world is now dormant after World War II and several smaller wars thereafter. Diplomatic conflicts between the more than 200 countries have continued, but even if the conflict reaches an extreme level, it does not easily lead to a war. The reason is that the great development of science has expanded the scope of war from only military to civilian. We realized it through the World War II, and the scope has now grown much larger with the constant development of science. That is why even if countries criticize and provoke another country with missiles, it will not escalate into an all-out war. Then I'll see how the war affects citizens. War mainly has negative effects, but I will also look at the positive effects.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;War affects citizens in three imposition major ways, one of which is an invasion of freedom. In the event of war, the government declares martial law first to maintain security and order. Martial law is the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions by a government. So the rights of the people can be ignored. During the war, food production and distribution become difficult, the government starts rationing for efficient and equitable distribution of food. You can't get as much food as you want even if you have a lot of money. In addition, government can impose a curfew. In extreme cases, the government may not allow citizens to leave shelters or their homes. The freedom of diet and residence, two of the three basic elements of human life, is lost to the state. </p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the war, we can be subjected to violence from our and enemy forces both. Citizens can be directly exposed to distant attacks such as enemy missiles or the chemical weapons, and they can be indirectly damaged by the explosion of industrial facilities or the collapse of buildings. We can also be subjected to violence by our soldiers. When the war begins, the authority of the military improves greatly and they can eventually abuse or tyrannize citizens.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;ar brings a huge financial loss for the nation and this loss is passed on to citizens. The characteristic of this effect is that it has a great influence for a long time even after the war. First of all, bombing could destroy real assets such as houses and cars, and there could also be huge losses on financial assets due to a plunge in the foreign exchange rate. In addition, the government uses astronomical amounts of money for the military for the war. Even if there is no battle, military spending is increased to guard their country. In addition, normal production of companies and factories will be impossible, resulting in opportunity costs. After the war, it takes a huge amount of money to restore the nation's destroyed industrial infrastructure and if we had lost the war, we would have to pay astronomical compensation to the extent that national existence is at stake.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;War doesn’t give only bad influences to ours. First, when war breaks out, the people who were divided into politics or society face a common enemy. The people will be able to unite, which has not been easy. Also, there is a baby boom for a while after the war. In the event of war, as the nature of animals is maximized rather than for the opposite sex, humans have a greater appetite for living and a greater desire to reproduce. When the war is over, there will be a "baby boom" by adding a hopeful atmosphere to society. In many advanced countries, birth rates are a serious problem, and war can help this problem. Finally, the status of women in society is strengthened. If the war is prolonged, it is difficult for men to engage in social activities because most men enter the military. So woman are given all the work, and their status strengthens</p>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Even with a few good effects, both countries end up losing huge amounts of money in the war. I explained the damage suffered by ordinary citizens during the war, but in fact, the damage suffered by soldiers is greater. Soldiers suffer severe trauma from gunshot or explosions, or mental damage that a person who has never killed a person has to kill. And in fact, soldiers are among the families of ordinary citizens. Citizens also suffer the death of their families. The war must be prevented in any way.</p>
